1	619	485	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2	619	120	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3	619	754	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4	619	389	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
5	619	23	Not so bad, thanks, you?
6	619	657	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
7	292	926	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
8	292	561	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
9	292	427	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
10	292	62	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
11	292	696	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
12	292	331	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
13	292	965	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
14	292	600	Where is the dairy products?
15	292	234	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
16	868	503	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
17	868	369	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
18	868	4	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
19	868	638	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
20	868	273	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
21	868	907	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
22	542	176	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
23	542	810	Am sorry. what was your name again?
24	542	445	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
25	542	311	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
26	542	946	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
27	542	580	What grade is she going to teach?
28	542	215	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
29	542	849	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
30	542	484	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
31	118	753	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
32	118	387	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
33	118	253	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
34	118	888	What is she doing these days?
35	118	522	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
36	157	791	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
37	157	426	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
38	157	60	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
39	157	695	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
40	329	195	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
41	329	830	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
42	329	464	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
43	329	99	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
44	329	733	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
45	329	368	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
46	2	637	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
47	2	271	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
48	2	138	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
49	2	772	Morning. How’s are you today?
50	2	406	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
51	2	41	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
52	2	675	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
53	2	310	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
54	2	944	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
55	579	213	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
56	579	80	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
57	579	714	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
58	579	187	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
59	579	730	What grade is she going to teach?
60	579	596	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
61	231	865	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
62	231	500	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
63	231	113	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
64	231	586	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
65	231	220	Freezing cold, and snowing.
66	231	855	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
67	231	489	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
68	231	356	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
69	828	463	Not so bad, thanks, you?
70	828	97	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
71	828	964	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
72	828	598	Really? Where are you from?
73	828	233	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
74	828	614	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
75	319	23	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
76	319	496	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
77	319	131	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
78	319	765	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
79	319	632	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
80	319	266	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
81	901	535	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
82	901	169	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
83	901	804	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
84	901	438	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
85	901	73	Not so bad, thanks, you?
86	901	707	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
87	901	574	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
88	901	208	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
89	681	315	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
90	681	182	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
91	681	816	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
92	681	451	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
93	681	85	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
94	681	720	Where is the dairy products?
95	681	354	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
96	681	988	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
97	623	328	What is she doing these days?
98	623	962	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
99	623	597	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
100	623	231	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
101	623	865	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
102	623	732	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
103	623	366	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
104	623	909	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
105	623	544	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
106	623	178	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
107	813	447	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
108	813	152	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
109	813	786	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
110	813	421	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
111	813	55	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
112	813	690	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
113	813	324	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
114	813	191	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
115	813	825	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
116	813	460	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
117	94	729	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
118	363	997	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
119	363	632	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
120	363	266	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
121	363	133	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
122	363	767	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
123	363	402	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
124	363	36	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
125	363	671	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
126	363	305	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
127	363	939	Where is the dairy products?
128	574	208	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
129	75	709	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
130	75	344	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
131	978	613	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
132	978	247	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
133	978	882	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
134	978	516	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
135	978	150	Am sorry. what was your name again?
136	17	651	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
137	17	286	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
138	17	920	What grade is she going to teach?
139	17	555	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
140	189	824	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
141	189	528	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
142	189	163	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
143	189	797	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
144	189	432	Morning. How’s are you today?
145	189	66	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
146	701	335	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
147	701	202	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
148	701	836	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
149	701	470	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
150	701	105	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
151	701	739	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
152	701	374	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
153	701	8	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
154	643	277	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
155	643	144	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
156	643	778	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
157	643	412	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
158	643	47	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
159	643	681	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
160	643	316	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
161	643	950	Freezing cold, and snowing.
162	643	585	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
163	643	219	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
164	86	720	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
165	86	355	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
166	86	989	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
167	623	258	Really? Where are you from?
168	892	527	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
169	892	161	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
170	892	28	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
171	892	662	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
172	892	297	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
173	892	931	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
174	892	565	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
175	892	200	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
176	892	834	How often do you eat at this cafe?
177	892	469	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
178	103	970	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
179	103	604	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
358	653	31	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
180	103	239	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
181	873	508	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
182	873	142	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
183	873	776	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
184	873	411	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
185	873	45	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
186	873	912	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
187	873	546	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
188	873	181	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
189	873	815	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
190	873	450	Where is the dairy products?
191	84	718	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
192	353	987	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
193	353	854	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
194	353	488	What movie are you and the family going to see?
195	353	123	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
196	353	757	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
197	353	392	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
198	353	26	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
199	353	661	Am sorry. what was your name again?
200	353	295	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
201	353	929	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
202	796	430	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
203	796	65	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
204	796	699	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
205	334	968	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
206	603	237	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
207	603	872	Morning. How’s are you today?
208	603	738	What is she doing these days?
209	603	372	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
210	603	7	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
211	603	641	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
212	603	276	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
213	603	910	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
214	603	545	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
215	603	179	What movie are you and the family going to see?
216	814	680	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
217	314	949	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
218	314	583	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
219	218	852	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
220	218	487	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
221	218	121	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
222	218	826	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
223	218	460	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
224	95	729	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
225	95	364	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
226	230	865	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
227	230	499	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
228	230	134	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
229	230	768	Really? Where are you from?
230	230	402	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
231	230	37	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
232	230	671	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
233	306	172	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
234	306	807	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
235	306	441	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
236	76	710	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
237	76	344	How often do you eat at this cafe?
238	76	979	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
239	613	248	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
240	114	749	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
241	114	383	Not so bad, thanks, you?
242	18	652	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
243	18	287	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
244	18	921	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
245	18	555	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
246	18	190	What grade is she going to teach?
247	56	691	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
248	56	325	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
249	56	960	Where is the dairy products?
250	56	594	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
251	229	863	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
252	229	498	What is she doing these days?
253	229	132	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
254	229	766	What movie are you and the family going to see?
255	229	633	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
256	229	267	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
257	902	536	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
258	902	171	Am sorry. what was your name again?
259	902	805	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
260	902	440	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
261	902	74	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
262	902	708	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
263	902	575	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
264	902	209	Freezing cold, and snowing.
265	902	844	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
266	478	113	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
267	478	747	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
268	478	382	Morning. How’s are you today?
269	478	16	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
270	478	651	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
271	478	517	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
272	151	786	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
273	151	420	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
274	151	55	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
275	151	689	What movie are you and the family going to see?
276	151	324	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
277	151	958	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
278	151	593	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
279	151	459	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
280	151	93	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
281	728	362	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
282	728	997	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
283	728	631	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
284	728	266	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.

295	725	359	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
296	725	993	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.

299	860	763	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
300	860	398	What is she doing these days?

306	6	818	Really? Where are you from?
307	452	319	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
308	953	588	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
309	953	222	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
310	953	856	She will be happy to meet both of you again.

320	433	702	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
321	433	407	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
322	433	111	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
323	433	746	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
324	433	380	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
325	433	15	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
326	433	649	What’s the weather like in Russia now?

330	553	53	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
331	553	688	What is she doing these days?
332	553	322	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
333	553	865	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
334	553	500	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
335	553	134	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
336	553	769	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.

359	653	665	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.

375	641	544	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
376	641	179	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
377	641	813	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
378	641	447	What is she doing these days?
379	641	314	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
380	641	948	What movie are you and the family going to see?
381	583	217	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
382	583	852	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
383	583	486	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
384	583	121	Am sorry. what was your name again?
385	583	755	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
386	583	390	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
387	583	94	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
388	583	729	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
389	583	363	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
390	583	998	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
391	632	499	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
392	133	767	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
393	133	402	Morning. How’s are you today?
394	133	36	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
395	133	671	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
396	133	305	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
397	133	940	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
398	133	574	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
399	133	441	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
400	133	75	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
401	133	709	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
402	344	978	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
403	613	247	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
404	613	790	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
405	613	657	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
406	613	291	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
407	613	926	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
408	613	560	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
409	613	195	How often do you eat at this cafe?
410	613	829	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
411	613	463	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
412	613	98	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
413	732	599	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
414	732	233	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
415	732	868	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
416	732	502	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
417	732	137	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
418	732	771	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
419	732	406	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
420	732	40	What grade is she going to teach?
421	732	674	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
422	732	541	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
423	175	810	Where is the dairy products?
424	175	444	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
425	175	79	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
426	713	348	What is she doing these days?
427	713	982	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
428	713	617	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
429	713	321	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
430	713	956	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
431	713	590	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
432	713	225	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
433	713	859	Am sorry. what was your name again?
434	713	726	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
435	713	360	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
436	994	467	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
437	994	334	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
438	994	968	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
439	994	603	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
440	994	237	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
441	994	871	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
442	994	506	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
443	994	140	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
444	994	775	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
445	994	409	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
446	276	910	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
447	276	545	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
448	276	179	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
449	813	357	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
450	813	991	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
451	813	625	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
452	813	260	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
453	813	126	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
454	813	761	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
455	813	395	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
456	813	30	Where is the dairy products?
457	813	664	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
458	299	933	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
459	299	568	What is she doing these days?
460	299	202	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
461	299	68	What movie are you and the family going to see?
462	299	703	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
463	299	337	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
464	972	606	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
465	972	241	Am sorry. what was your name again?
466	972	875	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
467	972	510	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
468	972	144	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
469	972	10	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
470	972	645	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
471	972	279	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
472	972	752	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
473	619	253	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
474	619	887	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
475	619	522	Morning. How’s are you today?
476	619	156	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
477	619	791	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
478	619	425	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
479	60	694	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
480	60	561	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
481	60	195	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
482	60	830	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
483	60	464	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
484	60	98	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
485	60	733	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
486	367	2	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
487	367	636	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
488	367	503	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
489	367	137	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
490	367	772	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
491	406	40	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
492	406	675	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
493	406	309	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
494	944	578	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
495	445	79	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
496	445	714	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
497	348	983	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
498	348	617	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
499	348	251	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
500	348	886	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?

510	559	963	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
511	559	598	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.

517	232	271	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
518	232	905	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
519	232	540	Where is the dairy products?
520	232	174	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
521	809	443	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?

533	482	155	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
534	482	789	Freezing cold, and snowing.
535	482	424	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
536	58	693	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
537	58	327	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!

560	88	224	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.

604	472	741	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
605	472	375	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
606	472	10	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
607	472	876	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
608	472	511	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
609	472	145	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
610	472	779	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
611	472	414	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
612	48	683	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
613	48	317	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
614	48	952	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
615	48	818	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
616	48	453	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
617	48	87	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
618	722	356	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
619	722	990	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
620	722	625	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
621	722	259	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
622	722	894	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
623	722	760	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
624	722	395	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
625	722	29	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
626	722	664	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
627	298	932	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
628	298	567	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
629	298	201	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
630	298	836	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
631	298	702	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
632	337	971	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
633	337	606	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
634	337	240	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
635	337	875	How often do you eat at this cafe?
636	509	143	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
637	509	778	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
638	509	644	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
639	509	117	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
640	509	752	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
641	509	386	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
642	252	887	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
643	252	521	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
644	252	156	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
645	252	790	What grade is she going to teach?
646	252	425	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
647	252	59	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
648	252	694	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
649	252	328	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
650	252	195	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
651	252	829	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
652	463	98	What is she doing these days?
653	732	367	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
654	732	1	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
655	732	636	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
656	732	270	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
657	732	137	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
658	732	771	Am sorry. what was your name again?
659	732	405	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
660	732	40	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
661	732	674	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
662	732	309	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
663	943	578	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
664	943	212	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
665	943	79	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
666	943	713	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
667	943	348	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
668	943	982	Morning. How’s are you today?
669	943	616	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
670	943	251	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
671	943	885	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
672	943	520	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
673	154	21	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
674	655	290	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
675	655	924	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
676	558	193	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
677	558	827	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
678	558	462	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
679	558	96	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
680	558	731	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
681	558	597	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
682	232	866	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
683	232	501	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
684	232	135	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
685	232	769	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
686	232	404	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
687	232	38	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
688	232	673	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
689	232	539	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
690	232	174	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
691	808	443	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
692	808	77	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
693	808	712	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
694	808	346	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
695	808	980	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
696	615	481	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
697	615	116	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
698	615	750	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
699	615	385	How often do you eat at this cafe?
700	19	654	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
701	19	288	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
702	19	922	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
703	19	557	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
704	19	423	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
705	19	58	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
706	692	327	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
707	692	961	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
708	692	596	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
709	692	230	What grade is she going to teach?
710	692	865	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
711	692	499	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
712	692	365	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
713	692	1000	Where is the dairy products?
714	692	634	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
715	269	903	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
716	269	538	What is she doing these days?
717	269	172	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
718	269	807	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
719	269	441	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
720	269	307	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
781	48	317	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
721	942	576	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
722	942	211	Am sorry. what was your name again?
723	942	845	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
724	942	550	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
725	942	184	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
726	942	819	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
727	942	453	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
728	942	88	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
729	942	722	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
730	357	991	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
731	357	858	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
732	357	492	Morning. How’s are you today?
733	357	127	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
734	761	395	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
735	761	30	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
736	761	664	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
737	761	299	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
738	761	933	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
739	761	800	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
740	761	434	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
741	761	69	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
742	703	338	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
743	703	972	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
744	703	606	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
745	703	241	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
746	703	875	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
747	703	742	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
748	703	376	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
749	703	11	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
750	703	645	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
751	703	280	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
752	914	548	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
753	183	817	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
754	183	684	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
755	183	318	Really? Where are you from?
756	183	953	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
757	183	587	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
758	183	222	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
759	183	856	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
760	183	491	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
761	183	125	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
762	183	759	Where is the dairy products?
763	626	260	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
764	626	895	How often do you eat at this cafe?
765	626	529	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
766	164	798	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
767	433	67	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
768	433	701	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
769	433	568	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
770	433	202	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
771	433	837	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
772	433	471	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
773	433	106	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
774	433	740	What grade is she going to teach?
775	433	375	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
776	433	9	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
777	644	510	Where is the dairy products?
778	144	779	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
779	144	413	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
780	48	682	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
782	48	951	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
783	48	586	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
784	48	452	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
785	86	721	Am sorry. what was your name again?
786	86	355	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
787	86	990	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
788	86	624	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
789	259	893	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
790	259	528	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
791	259	394	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
792	259	29	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
793	259	663	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
794	259	297	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
795	932	566	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
796	932	201	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
797	932	835	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
798	932	470	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
799	932	336	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
800	932	971	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
801	932	605	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
802	932	240	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
803	932	874	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
804	508	143	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
805	508	777	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
806	508	412	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
807	508	117	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
808	508	751	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
809	508	385	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
810	20	654	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
811	20	521	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
812	20	155	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
813	20	790	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
814	20	424	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
815	20	59	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
816	20	693	Not so bad, thanks, you?
817	327	962	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
818	327	596	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
819	327	463	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
820	327	97	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
821	327	732	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
822	366	1	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
823	366	635	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
824	366	270	Where is the dairy products?
825	904	538	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
826	405	39	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
827	405	674	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
828	308	943	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
829	308	577	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
830	308	212	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
831	308	846	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
832	308	480	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
833	347	981	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
834	347	616	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
835	347	250	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
836	347	885	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
837	519	154	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
838	519	788	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
839	519	423	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
840	519	289	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
841	519	923	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
842	519	558	What is she doing these days?
843	192	827	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
844	192	461	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
845	192	96	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
846	192	730	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
847	192	365	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
848	192	231	Am sorry. what was your name again?
849	192	866	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
850	192	500	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
851	192	134	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
852	192	769	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
853	403	38	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
854	672	307	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
855	672	173	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
856	672	808	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
857	672	442	Morning. How’s are you today?
858	672	76	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
859	672	711	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
860	672	345	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
861	672	980	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
862	672	614	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
863	249	115	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
864	249	750	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
865	249	384	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
866	249	19	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
867	249	653	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
868	249	287	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
869	249	922	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
870	249	556	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
871	191	57	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
872	191	692	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
873	191	326	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
874	191	961	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
875	191	595	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
876	191	229	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
877	191	864	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
878	191	498	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
879	191	133	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
880	191	999	What grade is she going to teach?
881	634	268	Really? Where are you from?
882	903	537	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
883	903	172	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
884	903	806	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
885	903	440	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
886	903	75	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
887	903	941	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
888	903	576	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
889	903	210	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
890	903	845	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
891	903	549	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
892	184	818	What movie are you and the family going to see?
893	453	87	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
894	453	722	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
895	453	356	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
896	453	991	Am sorry. what was your name again?
897	453	625	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
898	453	492	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
899	453	126	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
900	453	760	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
901	453	395	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
902	453	29	Freezing cold, and snowing.
903	664	298	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
904	933	567	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
905	933	434	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
906	933	68	What is she doing these days?
907	933	702	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
908	933	337	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
909	933	971	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
910	933	606	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
911	933	240	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
912	933	875	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
913	933	509	What movie are you and the family going to see?
914	376	10	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
915	376	645	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
916	376	279	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
917	913	548	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
918	182	817	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
919	182	451	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
920	182	318	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
921	182	952	Morning. How’s are you today?
922	182	587	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
923	182	221	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
924	182	855	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
925	182	490	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
926	182	124	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
927	182	759	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
928	393	260	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
929	894	529	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
930	163	798	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
931	163	432	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
932	163	66	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
933	163	701	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
934	163	335	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
935	163	202	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
936	163	836	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
937	163	471	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
938	163	105	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
939	163	740	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
940	374	9	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
941	643	277	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
942	643	144	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
943	643	778	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
944	643	413	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
945	643	47	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
946	643	682	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
947	643	316	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
948	643	951	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
949	643	585	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
950	643	219	Where is the dairy products?
951	86	720	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
952	86	355	How often do you eat at this cafe?
953	86	989	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
954	624	258	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
955	893	527	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
956	893	162	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
957	893	28	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
958	893	662	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
959	893	297	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
960	893	931	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
961	893	566	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
962	893	200	What grade is she going to teach?
963	893	835	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?

967	604	873	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
968	508	142	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
969	508	777	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1341	152	460	Freezing cold, and snowing.
970	508	411	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.

978	288	58	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
979	288	692	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
980	288	327	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
981	288	961	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.

985	366	1000	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
986	366	635	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.

1015	768	403	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1016	768	37	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1017	768	672	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1018	768	306	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!

1024	441	979	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
1025	441	614	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1026	441	248	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1027	441	883	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.

1036	825	326	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1037	825	960	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1038	825	594	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1039	229	863	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1040	229	498	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1041	229	132	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1042	229	767	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.

1054	317	183	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1055	317	818	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1056	317	452	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1057	317	87	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1058	721	356	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1059	721	990	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1060	721	624	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1061	721	259	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1062	721	125	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1063	721	760	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1064	721	394	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1065	721	29	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1066	663	298	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1067	663	932	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
1068	663	567	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1069	663	201	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1070	663	67	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1071	663	702	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1072	663	336	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1073	663	971	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1074	663	605	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
1075	663	240	Where is the dairy products?
1076	874	509	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1077	143	10	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1078	143	644	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1079	143	278	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1080	143	913	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1081	143	547	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1082	143	182	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1083	143	816	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1084	143	451	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1085	143	85	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1086	143	952	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1087	586	220	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1088	586	855	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1089	586	489	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1090	124	758	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1091	393	27	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1092	393	894	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1093	393	528	What is she doing these days?
1094	393	163	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1095	393	797	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1462	429	833	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1096	393	431	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1097	393	66	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1098	393	700	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1099	393	335	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1100	393	969	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1101	836	470	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1102	836	105	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1103	836	739	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1104	373	8	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1105	642	277	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1106	642	911	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1107	642	778	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1108	642	412	Morning. How’s are you today?
1109	642	47	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1110	642	681	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1111	642	316	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1112	642	950	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1113	642	584	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1114	642	219	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
1115	853	720	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1116	354	989	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1117	623	258	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1118	623	892	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1119	623	526	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1120	623	161	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1121	623	795	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1122	623	662	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1123	623	296	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1124	623	931	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1125	623	565	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
1126	623	200	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1127	834	469	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1128	103	737	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1129	103	604	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1130	103	238	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
1131	103	873	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1132	103	507	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1133	103	980	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1134	103	846	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1135	103	481	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1136	103	115	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1137	103	750	Where is the dairy products?
1138	384	19	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1139	653	288	What is she doing these days?
1140	653	922	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1141	653	789	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1142	653	423	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1143	653	57	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1144	653	692	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1145	653	326	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1146	653	961	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1147	653	595	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1148	653	230	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1149	864	731	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1150	864	365	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1151	864	999	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1152	634	268	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
1153	903	537	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1154	903	172	Morning. How’s are you today?
1155	903	806	What is she doing these days?
1643	613	17	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1156	903	673	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1157	903	307	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.

1160	903	210	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1161	903	845	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1162	903	479	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1163	114	748	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1164	615	249	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1165	615	884	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1166	518	152	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1167	518	787	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1168	518	421	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1169	518	56	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1170	518	690	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1171	557	191	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1172	557	826	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1173	557	460	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1174	557	95	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1175	729	363	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1176	729	998	Really? Where are you from?
1177	729	632	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
1178	729	499	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1179	729	133	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1180	729	768	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1181	402	37	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1182	402	671	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1183	402	306	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1184	402	940	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1185	402	574	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1186	402	441	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1187	402	75	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1188	402	710	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1189	402	344	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1190	979	613	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1191	979	248	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1192	979	882	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
1193	979	516	What’s the weather like in Russia now?

1195	979	17	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1196	652	286	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1197	652	921	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1198	652	555	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
1199	652	190	Where is the dairy products?
1200	652	824	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1201	652	459	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1202	652	325	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1203	652	959	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1204	652	594	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.

1209	228	401	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1210	228	267	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1211	901	536	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1212	901	170	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1213	901	805	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1214	901	439	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1215	901	74	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1216	901	708	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
1217	901	413	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
1218	901	47	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1219	901	682	Morning. How’s are you today?
1220	316	951	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1221	316	817	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.

1224	721	355	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1225	721	989	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1226	721	624	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1227	721	258	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1228	721	893	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1229	721	759	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1230	721	394	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?

1244	142	643	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1245	142	278	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1246	142	912	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1247	142	547	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1248	142	181	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.

1251	142	85	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1252	142	719	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1253	585	220	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1254	585	854	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1255	585	489	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1256	123	758	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1257	123	392	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
1258	123	27	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1259	123	661	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1260	123	527	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1261	123	162	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1262	123	796	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1263	123	431	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1264	123	65	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1265	123	700	Where is the dairy products?
1266	334	969	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1267	603	470	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1268	603	104	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1269	603	738	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1270	603	373	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1271	603	7	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1272	603	642	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1273	603	276	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1274	603	911	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1275	603	545	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1276	603	412	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1277	46	681	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1278	46	315	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1279	46	949	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1280	584	218	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2080	466	370	Where is the dairy products?
1281	853	487	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1282	853	354	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1283	853	988	What is she doing these days?
1284	853	623	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1285	853	257	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1286	853	891	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1287	853	526	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1288	853	160	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1289	853	795	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1290	853	429	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1291	296	930	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1292	296	565	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1293	296	199	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1294	834	468	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1295	102	737	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1296	102	371	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1297	102	238	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1298	102	872	Morning. How’s are you today?
1299	102	507	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1300	102	979	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1301	102	614	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1302	102	480	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1303	102	115	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1304	102	749	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
1305	384	18	Really? Where are you from?
1306	653	287	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1307	653	921	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1308	653	556	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1309	653	422	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1310	653	57	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1311	653	691	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
1312	653	326	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1313	653	960	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1314	653	595	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1315	653	229	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1316	864	498	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1317	364	999	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1318	364	633	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1319	268	902	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
1320	268	537	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1321	268	171	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1322	268	806	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1323	268	440	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1324	307	941	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1325	307	575	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1326	307	210	Where is the dairy products?
1327	307	844	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1328	479	113	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1329	479	748	What is she doing these days?
1330	479	382	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1331	479	249	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1332	479	883	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1333	479	517	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1334	152	786	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1335	152	421	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1336	152	55	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1337	152	690	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1338	152	324	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1339	152	191	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1340	152	825	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1342	152	94	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1343	728	363	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
1344	728	997	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1345	728	632	Morning. How’s are you today?
1346	728	266	What is she doing these days?
1347	728	133	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1348	728	767	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1349	402	36	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1350	402	670	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1351	402	305	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1352	402	939	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1353	402	574	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1354	402	208	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1355	402	75	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1356	402	709	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1357	402	344	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1358	978	613	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1359	978	247	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1360	978	881	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1361	978	516	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1362	978	150	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1363	17	651	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1364	17	286	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1365	17	920	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1366	17	555	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1367	189	823	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1368	189	458	Really? Where are you from?
1369	189	92	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
1370	189	959	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1371	189	593	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1372	189	228	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1373	862	497	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1374	862	131	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1375	862	766	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1376	862	400	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1377	862	34	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1378	862	901	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1379	862	535	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1380	862	170	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1381	862	804	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1382	439	73	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1383	439	708	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1384	439	412	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1385	439	47	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1386	439	681	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1387	439	316	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1388	950	585	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1389	950	451	Im going to watch Terminator 4.

1397	258	393	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1398	258	28	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1399	258	662	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1400	296	931	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1401	296	565	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1828	862	169	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1402	296	200	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1403	296	834	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1404	469	335	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?

1435	968	237	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.

1466	102	5	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1467	102	640	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1468	102	506	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1469	102	979	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1470	102	613	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1471	102	248	Freezing cold, and snowing.

1490	998	902	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1491	998	536	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1492	998	171	Right! So this must be like summer for you!

1497	439	209	What grade is she going to teach?
1498	439	844	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1499	439	478	Really? Where are you from?
1500	439	113	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1501	747	382	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1502	747	16	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1503	747	882	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1504	747	517	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1505	151	786	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1506	151	420	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1507	151	55	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1508	151	689	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1509	151	324	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1510	151	958	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1511	151	824	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1512	151	459	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1513	151	93	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1514	728	362	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1515	728	997	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1516	728	631	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1517	728	266	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1518	728	900	What grade is she going to teach?
1519	767	401	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1520	767	35	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1521	767	670	Where is the dairy products?
1522	767	304	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1523	939	573	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1524	939	208	What is she doing these days?
2081	466	4	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1525	939	842	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
1526	939	709	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1527	939	343	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1528	939	978	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1529	612	246	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1530	612	881	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1531	612	515	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1532	612	150	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1533	612	784	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1534	612	651	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1535	612	285	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1536	612	920	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1537	612	554	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1538	188	823	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
1539	188	457	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1540	188	92	Morning. How’s are you today?
1541	188	726	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1542	188	593	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1543	188	227	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1544	862	496	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1545	862	131	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1546	862	765	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1547	862	399	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1548	862	34	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1549	862	668	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1550	862	535	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1551	862	169	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1552	862	804	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1553	438	73	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1554	438	777	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1555	438	412	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1556	438	46	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1557	438	681	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1558	315	950	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1559	315	584	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1560	218	85	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1561	218	719	What grade is she going to teach?
1562	218	354	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1563	218	988	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
1564	218	623	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1565	218	257	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1566	892	526	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1567	892	161	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1568	892	27	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1569	892	661	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
1570	892	296	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1571	892	930	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1572	892	565	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1573	892	199	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1574	892	834	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1575	468	103	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1576	468	737	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1577	468	604	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1578	468	238	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1579	468	872	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1892	45	680	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1580	507	141	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1581	507	776	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1582	507	410	What grade is she going to teach?
1583	507	45	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1584	679	546	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1585	679	180	Where is the dairy products?
1586	679	814	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1587	679	449	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1588	679	83	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1589	679	718	What is she doing these days?
1590	679	352	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1591	679	987	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1592	621	488	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1593	621	122	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1594	621	757	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1595	621	391	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1596	621	25	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1597	621	660	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1598	621	294	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1599	621	929	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1600	621	563	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1601	621	430	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1602	64	699	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
1603	333	967	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1604	333	602	Morning. How’s are you today?
1605	333	236	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1606	333	871	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1607	333	505	Really? Where are you from?
1608	333	372	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1609	333	6	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1610	333	641	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1611	333	275	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1612	333	910	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1613	544	178	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1614	813	447	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
1615	813	314	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1616	813	948	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1617	813	583	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1618	813	217	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1619	813	852	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1620	813	486	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1621	813	121	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1622	813	755	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
1623	813	389	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
1624	256	890	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1625	256	525	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1626	256	159	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
1627	794	428	Really? Where are you from?
1628	63	697	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1629	63	331	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1630	63	198	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1631	63	832	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1632	63	467	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1633	63	101	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1634	63	736	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1635	63	370	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1636	63	75	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1637	63	709	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1638	344	978	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1639	613	247	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1640	613	882	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1641	613	748	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.

1650	325	959	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1651	325	593	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1652	228	862	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1653	228	497	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.

1660	267	804	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1661	439	73	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?

1668	112	381	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1669	112	15	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1670	112	650	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1671	112	516	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1672	112	151	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1673	112	785	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1674	112	420	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1675	112	54	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1676	689	323	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1677	689	957	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1678	689	592	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1679	689	458	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1680	689	93	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?

1683	362	631	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1684	362	265	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
1685	362	900	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1686	362	534	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1687	362	400	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1688	362	35	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1689	362	669	What grade is she going to teach?
1690	362	304	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1691	938	573	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1692	938	207	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1693	938	842	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1694	938	476	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1695	938	342	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
1696	977	611	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
1697	977	246	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1698	977	880	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1699	977	515	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1700	149	784	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1701	149	418	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1702	149	285	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
1703	149	919	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1704	149	553	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1705	149	188	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1706	822	457	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1707	822	91	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1708	822	726	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1709	822	360	What grade is she going to teach?
1710	822	227	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
1711	822	861	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1712	822	495	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1713	822	130	Where is the dairy products?
1714	822	764	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1715	822	399	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1716	33	668	What is she doing these days?
1717	302	169	What movie are you and the family going to see?
1718	302	803	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1719	302	276	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1720	302	910	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1721	302	545	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1722	302	411	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1723	302	46	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1724	302	680	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1725	302	315	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1726	949	583	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1727	949	218	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1728	949	852	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1729	949	487	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
1730	949	353	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
1731	949	988	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1732	622	257	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1733	622	891	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1734	622	526	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1735	622	160	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1736	622	794	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1737	622	429	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1738	622	295	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1739	622	930	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1740	622	564	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1741	199	833	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1742	199	468	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1743	199	102	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1744	199	736	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1745	199	371	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1746	199	237	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1747	872	506	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1748	872	141	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1749	872	775	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
1750	872	410	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1751	872	44	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1752	872	679	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1753	872	313	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1754	872	179	What grade is she going to teach?
1755	872	814	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1756	448	83	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1757	448	717	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
1758	448	352	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1759	448	986	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1760	448	621	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1761	448	255	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1762	121	756	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1763	121	390	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1764	121	25	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1765	121	659	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1766	121	294	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1767	121	928	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1768	121	563	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1769	121	197	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1770	121	64	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1771	698	332	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1772	698	967	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1773	698	601	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1774	698	236	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1775	698	870	What grade is she going to teach?
1776	505	139	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1777	505	6	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1778	640	275	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1779	640	909	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1780	640	543	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1781	640	178	What is she doing these days?
1782	640	812	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1783	640	447	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1784	640	81	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1785	948	582	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1786	948	217	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
1787	948	851	Am sorry. what was your name again?
1788	948	485	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
1789	948	120	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
1790	754	389	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1791	754	23	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
1792	890	524	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1793	890	159	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
1794	890	793	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
1795	890	428	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1796	890	62	Morning. How’s are you today?
1797	890	696	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1798	890	331	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1799	965	832	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1800	965	466	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
1801	965	101	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1802	965	735	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1803	965	370	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1804	74	709	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1805	74	343	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1806	978	612	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1807	978	247	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1808	978	881	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1809	978	516	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1810	978	382	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1811	16	651	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
1812	16	285	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1813	16	920	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1814	16	554	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1815	189	823	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1816	189	458	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1817	189	324	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1818	189	958	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
1819	189	593	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1820	189	227	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1821	862	496	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1822	862	131	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1823	862	765	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
1824	862	400	Where is the dairy products?
1825	862	266	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1826	862	901	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1827	862	535	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1829	862	804	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1830	438	73	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1831	438	707	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
1832	438	342	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1833	438	208	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
1834	438	843	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1835	438	477	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1836	111	746	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1837	111	380	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1838	111	15	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
1839	111	649	Freezing cold, and snowing.
1840	111	284	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
1841	111	150	Where is the dairy products?
1842	111	785	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.

1853	727	264	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1854	899	533	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1855	899	168	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

1858	899	303	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?

1868	572	514	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
1869	149	783	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
1870	149	418	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
1871	149	52	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1872	149	918	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
1873	149	553	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
1874	149	187	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1875	822	456	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.

1877	822	725	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
1878	822	360	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
1879	822	994	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1880	822	860	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
1881	822	495	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1882	822	129	What grade is she going to teach?
1883	822	764	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.

1887	398	936	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1888	398	803	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1889	275	910	Where is the dairy products?
1890	275	544	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1891	275	179	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1893	45	314	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1894	948	583	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1895	948	217	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
1896	948	852	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
1897	948	486	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
1898	948	121	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1899	948	987	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?

1918	409	44	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
1919	409	678	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

1930	82	755	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1931	82	390	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1932	82	24	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.

1943	332	504	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
1944	332	139	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1945	332	773	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1946	332	639	What grade is she going to teach?
1947	332	274	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
1948	908	543	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
1949	908	177	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
1950	908	812	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
1951	908	446	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
1952	908	81	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1953	908	715	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1954	582	216	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
1955	582	850	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
1956	582	485	How often do you eat at this cafe?
1957	582	119	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
1958	582	754	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
1959	582	388	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
1960	582	23	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
1961	582	657	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
1962	582	524	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
1963	158	793	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
1964	158	427	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
1965	158	61	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
1966	158	696	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
1967	158	330	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
1968	965	599	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
1969	965	466	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
1970	100	735	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
1971	100	369	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
1972	100	74	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
1973	100	708	What is she doing these days?
1974	100	343	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
1975	100	977	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
1976	100	612	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
1977	246	880	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
1978	246	515	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
1979	246	149	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1980	16	650	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
1981	16	285	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
1982	16	919	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
1983	554	188	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
1984	823	457	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
1985	823	91	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
1986	823	958	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
1987	823	592	Not so bad, thanks, you?
1988	823	227	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
1989	823	861	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
1990	823	496	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
1991	823	130	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
1992	823	765	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
1993	823	399	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
1994	33	900	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
1995	534	169	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
1996	534	803	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
1997	438	72	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
1998	438	707	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
1999	438	341	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2000	438	976	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2001	438	842	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2002	476	111	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2003	476	745	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2004	476	380	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2005	476	14	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
2006	649	283	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2007	649	918	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2008	649	784	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2009	649	419	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
2010	649	53	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2011	649	687	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2012	322	956	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2013	322	591	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2014	322	225	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
2015	322	860	Where is the dairy products?
2016	322	726	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2017	322	361	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2018	322	995	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2019	322	629	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2020	322	264	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2021	898	533	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2022	898	167	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
2023	898	802	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2024	898	668	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2025	898	303	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2026	898	937	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2027	572	206	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2028	572	840	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2029	572	475	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2030	572	109	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2031	572	744	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
2032	572	610	Where is the dairy products?
2033	572	245	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2034	572	879	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2035	572	514	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2036	148	782	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2037	148	417	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2038	148	51	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2039	148	686	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2040	148	552	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
2041	187	821	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2042	187	456	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2043	187	90	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
2044	187	725	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2045	359	993	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2046	359	628	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

2060	679	313	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?

2063	679	217	She will be happy to meet both of you again.

2139	207	708	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.

2164	33	803	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2165	33	437	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2166	33	72	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2167	33	706	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2168	33	341	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2169	33	975	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2170	33	609	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2171	476	110	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2172	476	745	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2173	476	379	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
2174	14	648	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
2175	283	917	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2176	283	551	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2177	283	418	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2178	283	52	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2179	283	687	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2180	283	321	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2181	283	956	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2182	283	590	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
2183	283	225	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2184	283	859	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2185	494	360	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2186	994	629	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2187	994	263	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2188	898	532	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
2189	898	167	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2190	898	801	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2191	898	436	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2192	898	302	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2193	936	571	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2194	936	205	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2195	936	840	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2196	936	474	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2197	109	743	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2198	109	378	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2199	109	244	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2200	109	879	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
2201	109	513	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2202	109	147	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2203	782	416	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2205	782	685	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
2206	782	320	Where is the dairy products?
2207	782	186	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2208	782	821	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2209	782	455	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2210	782	90	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2211	782	724	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2212	358	993	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2213	358	627	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2214	358	262	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2215	358	128	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2216	358	763	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2217	358	397	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2218	32	504	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2219	32	371	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2220	32	5	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2221	32	640	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2222	32	274	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
2223	32	909	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2224	32	543	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
2225	177	812	Morning. How’s are you today?
2226	177	446	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2227	177	313	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2228	177	947	Really? Where are you from?
2229	177	582	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2230	216	851	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2231	216	485	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2232	216	120	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2233	754	388	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2234	255	889	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2235	255	524	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2236	158	793	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2237	158	427	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2238	158	62	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2239	158	696	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2240	158	330	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2241	197	831	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2242	197	466	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2243	197	100	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2244	197	735	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2245	369	4	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2246	369	638	Really? Where are you from?
2247	369	273	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
2248	369	139	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2249	369	773	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2250	369	408	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2251	42	677	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2252	42	311	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2253	42	946	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2254	42	580	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2255	42	215	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
2256	42	81	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2257	42	716	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2258	42	350	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2259	42	984	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2260	42	619	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
2261	253	888	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2262	522	157	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
2263	522	23	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2264	522	658	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2265	522	292	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2266	522	926	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2267	522	561	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2268	522	195	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2269	522	830	Where is the dairy products?
2270	522	464	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2271	99	965	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2272	99	600	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2273	99	234	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2274	99	869	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2275	99	503	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2276	99	137	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2277	99	772	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2278	99	406	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2279	41	907	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2280	41	542	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2281	41	176	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2282	41	811	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2283	41	445	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2284	41	79	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2285	41	714	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
2286	41	348	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2287	41	983	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2288	41	849	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
2289	484	118	What is she doing these days?
2290	753	387	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2291	753	22	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2292	753	656	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2293	753	290	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2294	753	925	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2295	753	791	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
2296	753	426	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2297	753	60	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
2298	753	695	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2299	753	329	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
2300	964	598	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
2301	303	937	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2302	303	572	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2303	303	206	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2304	303	841	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2305	303	475	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2306	303	342	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2307	303	976	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2308	303	610	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2309	303	245	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2310	303	879	What grade is she going to teach?
2311	514	148	Really? Where are you from?
2312	783	417	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2313	783	284	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2314	783	918	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2315	783	552	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2316	783	187	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2317	783	821	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2318	783	456	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2319	783	90	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2320	783	725	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2321	783	359	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
2322	226	860	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2323	226	495	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2324	226	129	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
2325	763	398	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.

2329	32	802	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2330	32	437	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2331	32	71	Im going to watch Terminator 4.

2334	32	974	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2335	32	609	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2336	243	110	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2337	744	379	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2338	13	648	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2339	13	282	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2340	13	916	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2341	13	551	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2342	13	185	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2343	13	52	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2344	13	686	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.

2346	13	955	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2347	13	590	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2348	224	859	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2349	493	127	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2350	493	762	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2351	493	628	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2352	493	263	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2353	493	897	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2354	493	532	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2355	493	166	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2356	493	801	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2357	493	435	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2358	493	69	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2359	704	570	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2360	704	205	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2361	704	839	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
2362	474	108	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
2363	743	377	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2364	743	12	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2365	743	646	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2366	743	512	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2367	743	147	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2368	743	781	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2369	743	416	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2370	743	50	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
2371	743	685	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2372	743	319	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2373	954	588	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2374	454	89	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2375	454	723	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2376	358	992	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2377	358	627	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2378	358	261	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.

2381	397	31	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2382	397	665	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2383	397	138	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2384	397	5	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2385	639	274	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
2386	639	908	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2387	639	542	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2388	639	177	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2389	639	811	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2390	639	446	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2391	80	947	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2392	80	581	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2393	80	216	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2394	80	850	Where is the dairy products?
2395	80	485	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2396	80	119	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2397	80	753	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2398	80	388	What is she doing these days?
2399	80	22	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2400	889	523	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2401	889	158	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2402	889	792	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2403	889	427	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2404	889	61	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2405	889	695	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2406	330	964	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2407	330	831	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2408	330	465	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2409	330	100	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2410	330	734	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
2411	330	369	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2412	330	3	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
2413	638	272	Morning. How’s are you today?
2414	638	906	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2415	638	773	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2416	638	407	Really? Where are you from?
2417	638	42	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2418	676	311	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2419	676	945	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2420	676	580	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2421	214	848	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2422	715	349	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2423	715	984	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2424	618	253	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2425	618	887	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2426	618	522	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2427	618	156	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2428	618	791	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2429	618	657	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2430	291	926	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2431	291	560	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2432	291	195	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2433	291	829	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2434	291	464	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2435	291	98	Really? Where are you from?
2436	291	733	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2437	291	599	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2438	291	233	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2439	868	502	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2440	868	137	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2441	868	771	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2442	868	406	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2443	868	40	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2444	675	541	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2445	675	176	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2446	810	444	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2447	810	79	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
2448	810	713	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
2449	810	348	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3595	48	453	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
2450	810	982	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2451	810	617	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2452	810	483	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2453	118	752	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2454	118	387	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2455	118	21	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2456	118	655	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2457	118	290	Where is the dairy products?
2458	924	559	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2459	924	425	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2460	60	694	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2461	60	329	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2462	60	963	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2463	60	597	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2464	60	232	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2465	60	866	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2466	60	571	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2467	206	840	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
2468	206	474	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2469	206	109	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
2470	743	610	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2471	743	244	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2472	743	879	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2473	513	148	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2474	513	782	Morning. How’s are you today?
2475	513	417	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2476	513	51	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
2477	513	685	Really? Where are you from?
2478	513	552	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2479	513	186	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2480	513	821	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2481	513	455	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2482	513	90	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2483	724	359	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2484	993	627	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2485	993	494	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2486	993	128	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
2487	993	763	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2488	993	397	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
2489	993	32	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2490	993	666	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2491	993	301	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2492	993	935	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2493	993	570	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2494	436	70	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2495	436	705	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2496	436	339	What grade is she going to teach?
2497	974	608	Really? Where are you from?
2498	243	877	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2499	243	512	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2500	243	378	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2501	243	13	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2502	243	647	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2503	243	281	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2504	243	916	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2505	243	550	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2506	243	185	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2507	243	819	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
2508	454	320	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.

2511	223	858	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2512	492	127	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?

2514	492	396	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2515	492	262	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2516	492	897	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2517	492	531	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2518	492	166	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2519	492	800	Where is the dairy products?
2520	492	434	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2521	492	69	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2522	703	338	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2523	204	839	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2524	473	108	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2525	473	742	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2526	473	376	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?

2531	473	781	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2532	473	415	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?

2534	684	319	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2535	953	587	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2536	953	222	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2537	953	88	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.

2539	953	357	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2540	953	992	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2541	953	626	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2542	953	261	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2543	953	895	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2544	953	530	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2545	164	30	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2546	164	665	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2547	164	299	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2548	772	639	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.

2558	581	849	What grade is she going to teach?

2560	581	118	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
2561	581	753	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2562	581	387	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2563	581	22	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2564	581	656	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
2565	523	157	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2566	523	792	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper.

2611	175	809	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2612	175	444	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2613	78	713	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2614	78	347	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2615	78	982	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2616	78	616	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2617	78	251	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2618	78	117	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2619	751	386	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2620	751	20	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2621	751	655	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2622	751	289	What grade is she going to teach?
2623	751	924	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2624	751	558	Really? Where are you from?
2625	751	193	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2626	751	59	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2627	751	694	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2628	328	962	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2629	328	597	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2630	328	231	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2631	328	936	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2632	328	571	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2633	205	839	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2634	205	474	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2635	108	743	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2636	108	377	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
2637	108	244	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
2638	108	878	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2639	108	513	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2640	108	147	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2641	782	416	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2642	782	50	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2643	782	685	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2644	782	319	Morning. How’s are you today?
2645	782	186	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2646	782	820	Where is the dairy products?
2647	782	455	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2648	782	89	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2649	782	724	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2650	358	992	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2651	358	627	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2652	358	261	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
2653	358	128	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2654	358	762	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2655	397	31	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2656	397	666	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2657	397	300	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
2658	397	935	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2659	569	203	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2660	569	70	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2661	569	704	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2662	569	339	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2663	569	973	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
2664	569	608	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2665	242	877	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2666	242	511	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
2667	242	145	Really? Where are you from?
2668	242	12	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2669	242	646	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2670	242	281	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2671	242	915	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
2672	242	550	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2673	242	184	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
2674	819	453	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
2675	819	158	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2676	819	792	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2677	819	427	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2678	819	61	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2679	819	696	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2680	562	197	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
2681	562	831	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2682	562	465	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2683	562	100	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2684	562	734	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2685	562	369	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
2686	562	3	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2687	562	638	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2688	562	504	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3717	30	933	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
2689	139	773	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2690	139	408	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2691	139	42	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
2692	139	676	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2693	139	311	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2694	139	945	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2695	580	446	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2696	580	81	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2697	580	715	How often do you eat at this cafe?
2698	580	350	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2699	580	984	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2700	580	618	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2701	580	253	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2702	887	522	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2703	887	388	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
2704	887	23	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2705	887	657	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2706	887	292	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2707	926	561	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2708	926	195	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2709	926	829	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2710	464	330	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
2711	965	599	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2712	965	234	Morning. How’s are you today?
2713	706	573	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2714	706	207	Really? Where are you from?
2715	706	842	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2716	706	476	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2717	706	111	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2718	706	745	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2719	380	14	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
2720	380	648	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2721	380	515	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2722	380	149	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2723	380	784	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2724	380	418	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
2725	380	53	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2726	687	322	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.

2732	91	995	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2733	91	629	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2734	91	264	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2735	91	898	Really? Where are you from?
2736	91	533	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
2737	91	399	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2738	91	34	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?

2765	129	32	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2766	129	666	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2767	129	301	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.

2773	802	974	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
2774	802	608	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2775	802	243	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2776	802	109	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
2777	802	744	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2778	378	13	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2779	378	647	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.

2789	589	493	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2790	589	127	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2791	589	993	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
2792	589	628	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!

2794	262	531	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.

2814	23	658	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2815	292	927	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2816	292	561	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.

2827	273	908	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2828	273	542	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2829	273	177	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2830	273	811	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2831	273	445	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2832	273	312	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2833	273	946	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2834	273	581	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2835	273	215	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
2836	273	850	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2837	484	119	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2838	753	387	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2839	753	254	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2840	753	888	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2841	753	523	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2842	753	157	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
2843	753	792	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2844	753	426	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2845	753	61	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2846	753	695	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2847	753	330	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2848	196	830	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2849	196	465	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
2850	196	99	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2851	734	368	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
2852	3	637	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2853	3	272	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2854	3	138	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2855	3	772	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2856	3	407	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2857	3	41	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2858	3	676	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2859	3	310	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2860	3	945	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2861	3	579	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2862	214	80	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2863	715	349	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2864	715	983	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2865	618	252	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2866	618	887	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2926	552	993	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
2927	552	859	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2867	618	521	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2868	618	156	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2869	618	22	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2870	657	291	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2871	657	925	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2872	657	560	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2873	657	194	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2874	829	463	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
2875	829	98	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2876	829	964	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2877	829	437	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
2878	829	71	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
2879	829	706	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2880	340	207	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2881	340	841	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2882	340	476	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2883	340	110	Where is the dairy products?
2884	340	745	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2885	340	379	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
2886	340	13	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
2887	340	648	What is she doing these days?
2888	340	282	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2889	340	149	What movie are you and the family going to see?
2890	783	418	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2891	783	52	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2892	783	687	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2893	783	321	Am sorry. what was your name again?
2894	783	956	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
2895	783	590	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
2896	783	224	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2897	783	91	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2898	783	725	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2899	783	360	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2900	994	629	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2901	263	898	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2902	263	532	Morning. How’s are you today?
2903	263	166	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
2904	263	33	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
2905	263	667	Really? Where are you from?
2906	263	302	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2907	263	936	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2908	263	571	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
2909	263	205	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
2910	263	840	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2911	474	109	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
2912	975	609	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2913	975	244	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2914	878	513	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
2915	878	147	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
2916	878	782	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2917	878	416	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2918	878	51	Not so bad, thanks, you?
2919	878	917	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
2920	552	186	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2921	552	820	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2922	552	455	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2923	552	89	What grade is she going to teach?
2924	552	724	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
2925	552	358	Really? Where are you from?
2928	552	494	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2929	128	762	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2930	128	397	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2931	128	31	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2932	128	666	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2933	128	300	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2934	935	801	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2935	935	436	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
2936	935	70	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
2937	935	705	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
2938	339	973	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
2939	339	608	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
2940	339	242	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2941	339	877	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
2942	339	743	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
2943	339	378	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
2944	12	647	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
2945	12	281	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
2946	12	915	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
2947	12	550	Where is the dairy products?
2948	12	184	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
2949	12	819	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2950	12	685	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
2951	12	320	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
2952	12	954	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
2953	589	223	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
2954	589	858	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
2955	589	492	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
2956	589	126	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
2957	589	761	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
2958	589	627	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
2959	262	896	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
2960	262	531	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
2961	262	165	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2962	262	870	Freezing cold, and snowing.
2963	262	504	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2964	262	139	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
2965	262	773	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
2966	262	408	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
2967	262	42	Morning. How’s are you today?
2968	677	311	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
2969	677	178	Really? Where are you from?
2970	677	812	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
2971	677	446	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2972	81	715	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
2973	81	350	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
2974	81	984	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
2975	81	619	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
2976	81	253	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
2977	81	120	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
2978	81	754	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
2979	81	388	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
2980	23	657	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
2981	23	292	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
2982	23	926	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
2983	23	561	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
2984	23	195	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
2985	23	62	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
2986	23	696	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
2987	23	331	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
2988	23	965	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
2989	23	599	What grade is she going to teach?
2990	234	868	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3050	475	110	What grade is she going to teach?
2991	503	137	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
2992	503	4	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
2993	503	638	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
2994	503	273	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
2995	503	907	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
2996	503	541	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
2997	503	176	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
2998	503	810	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
2999	503	445	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3000	503	79	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3001	946	580	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3002	946	215	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3003	946	849	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3004	484	118	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3005	752	387	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3006	752	21	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3007	752	888	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3008	752	522	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3009	752	157	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3010	752	791	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3011	752	426	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3012	752	60	Where is the dairy products?
3013	752	694	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3014	752	329	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
3015	963	830	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3016	464	99	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3017	464	733	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3018	368	2	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3019	368	637	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3020	368	271	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3021	368	905	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3022	368	772	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3023	406	41	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3024	406	675	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3025	406	310	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3026	406	944	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3027	579	213	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3028	579	848	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3029	579	714	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3030	579	348	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3031	579	983	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3032	579	617	Really? Where are you from?
3033	252	886	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3034	252	521	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3035	252	155	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3036	252	790	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3037	252	656	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3038	252	290	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3039	252	925	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3040	252	559	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3041	252	194	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3042	828	463	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3043	828	97	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
3044	828	732	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3045	828	598	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3046	828	71	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3047	705	340	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3048	705	974	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3049	705	841	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3051	475	744	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3052	378	13	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
3053	378	647	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3054	378	282	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3055	378	916	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3056	378	783	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3057	378	417	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3058	52	686	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3059	52	320	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3060	52	955	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3061	52	589	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3062	52	224	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3063	52	858	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3064	52	725	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3065	52	359	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3066	52	994	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3067	628	263	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3068	628	897	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3069	628	531	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3070	628	166	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3071	628	800	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3072	667	301	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3073	667	936	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3074	667	570	Where is the dairy products?
3075	667	205	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3076	839	474	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3077	839	108	What is she doing these days?
3078	839	742	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3079	839	609	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3080	839	243	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3081	839	878	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3082	512	147	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3083	512	781	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3084	512	416	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3085	512	50	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3086	512	684	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
3087	512	551	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3088	512	185	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3089	512	820	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3090	512	454	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3091	89	723	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3092	89	358	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3093	89	992	Morning. How’s are you today?
3094	89	627	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3095	89	493	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3096	89	127	Really? Where are you from?
3097	762	396	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3098	762	31	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3099	762	665	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3100	762	300	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3101	762	934	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3102	762	569	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3103	762	435	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3104	762	69	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3105	762	704	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3106	338	973	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3107	338	607	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3108	338	242	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3109	338	876	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3110	338	511	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3111	338	377	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3112	12	646	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3113	12	280	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3114	12	915	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3115	12	549	What grade is she going to teach?
3116	12	184	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3117	12	818	Really? Where are you from?
3118	12	453	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3119	12	319	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3120	12	954	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3121	588	223	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3122	588	857	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3123	588	491	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3124	588	126	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3125	588	760	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3126	395	261	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3127	395	896	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3128	395	530	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3129	395	165	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3130	869	504	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3131	869	138	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3132	869	773	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3133	869	407	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3134	869	42	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3135	869	676	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3136	869	310	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3137	945	811	Morning. How’s are you today?
3138	945	446	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3139	80	715	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3140	80	349	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
3141	80	984	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3142	80	618	What is she doing these days?
3143	80	253	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3144	80	887	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3145	80	753	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3146	80	388	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3147	22	657	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3148	22	291	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3149	22	926	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3150	22	560	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3151	22	195	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3152	22	829	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3153	22	695	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3154	22	330	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3155	22	964	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3156	22	599	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3157	233	868	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3158	502	137	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3159	502	771	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3160	502	638	Really? Where are you from?
3161	502	272	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3162	502	906	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3163	502	541	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3164	502	175	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3165	502	810	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3166	502	444	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3167	79	713	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
3168	79	580	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3169	79	214	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3170	79	849	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3171	79	483	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3172	79	117	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3173	752	386	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3174	752	21	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3175	752	655	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3176	752	522	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3177	752	156	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3178	752	791	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3179	752	425	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.

3210	789	193	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3211	789	828	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3212	462	167	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3213	462	801	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?

3248	473	742	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.

3250	473	243	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?

3260	88	723	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3261	88	357	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3262	88	992	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.

3271	299	202	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3272	299	69	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3273	299	703	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3274	299	338	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3275	972	607	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3276	972	241	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3277	972	876	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3278	972	510	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3279	972	145	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
3280	972	11	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3281	972	645	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3282	972	280	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3283	972	914	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3284	549	183	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3285	549	818	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3286	549	452	Morning. How’s are you today?
3287	549	87	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3288	549	953	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3289	549	587	Really? Where are you from?
3290	222	856	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3291	222	491	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3292	222	125	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3293	222	830	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3294	222	464	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3295	222	99	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3296	222	733	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3297	222	368	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3298	222	2	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3299	637	503	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3300	637	138	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3301	637	772	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3302	637	407	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3303	41	675	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3304	41	310	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3305	41	944	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3306	41	579	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3307	41	445	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3308	41	80	What grade is she going to teach?
3309	41	714	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3310	41	349	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3311	983	618	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3312	983	252	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3313	983	886	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3314	983	521	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3315	983	387	What is she doing these days?
3316	983	22	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3317	983	656	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3318	983	291	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3319	983	925	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3320	983	560	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3321	194	828	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3322	463	329	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3323	463	964	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3324	463	598	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3325	463	233	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3326	463	867	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3327	463	502	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3328	463	136	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3329	463	771	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3330	463	405	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3331	463	271	Morning. How’s are you today?
3332	906	540	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3333	906	175	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3334	906	809	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
3335	444	78	What is she doing these days?
3336	713	347	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3337	713	213	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3338	713	848	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3339	713	482	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
3340	713	117	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3341	713	751	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3342	713	386	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3343	713	20	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3344	713	655	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3345	713	289	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3346	156	790	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3347	156	424	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3348	156	59	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3349	693	328	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3350	962	597	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3351	962	231	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3352	962	98	Really? Where are you from?
3353	962	732	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3354	962	366	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3355	962	1	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3413	261	569	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3356	962	635	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3357	962	270	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3358	962	904	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3359	539	173	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
3360	539	40	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3361	539	674	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3362	539	309	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3363	539	943	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3364	539	577	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3365	212	846	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3366	212	481	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3367	212	115	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3368	212	750	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3369	212	616	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3370	212	251	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3371	212	885	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3372	212	520	What grade is she going to teach?
3373	212	154	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3374	788	423	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
3375	788	128	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3376	788	762	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3377	788	397	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3378	788	31	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3379	788	665	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3380	300	166	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3381	300	801	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3382	300	435	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3383	300	70	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3384	300	704	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3385	300	339	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3386	300	973	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3387	300	607	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3388	300	242	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3389	108	743	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3390	108	377	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
3391	108	12	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3392	108	646	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3393	108	281	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3394	108	915	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3395	550	184	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3396	550	50	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3397	550	685	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3398	550	319	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3399	550	954	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3400	550	588	What is she doing these days?
3401	550	223	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3402	857	492	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.

3406	261	896	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3407	261	530	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3408	261	165	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3409	261	799	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3410	261	434	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3411	261	68	Freezing cold, and snowing.

3414	261	203	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
3415	838	472	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3416	838	107	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3417	838	741	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.

3451	972	645	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3452	972	279	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3453	972	914	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3454	548	183	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.

3459	587	221	Morning. How’s are you today?
3460	587	694	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3461	587	329	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3462	587	195	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3463	829	464	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3464	829	98	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3465	829	733	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3466	829	367	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3467	829	2	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3468	829	636	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3469	829	271	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3470	137	772	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3471	137	406	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3533	173	577	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3534	173	211	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3472	137	40	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3473	137	675	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3474	309	944	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3475	309	578	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

3481	617	251	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3482	617	886	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.

3484	617	155	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3485	21	656	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3486	21	290	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3487	21	925	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3488	21	559	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3489	21	193	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3490	21	828	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3491	21	462	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3492	21	97	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3493	731	598	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3494	731	232	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3495	731	867	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3496	731	501	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3497	731	135	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3498	731	770	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3499	731	404	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3500	731	39	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3501	731	673	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3502	731	540	What grade is she going to teach?
3503	174	809	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3504	443	78	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3505	443	712	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3506	443	346	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3507	443	981	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3508	443	615	What is she doing these days?
3509	443	482	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3510	443	116	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3511	443	751	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3512	443	385	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3513	443	20	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3514	654	289	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3515	923	557	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3516	923	424	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3517	923	58	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3518	923	693	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3519	923	327	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3520	923	962	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3521	923	596	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3522	923	231	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3523	923	865	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3524	923	499	Morning. How’s are you today?
3525	366	1000	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3526	366	635	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3527	366	269	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
3528	904	538	What is she doing these days?
3529	173	807	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3530	173	442	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3531	173	308	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3532	173	942	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
3535	173	846	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3536	173	480	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3537	173	115	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3538	173	749	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3539	384	250	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3540	384	884	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3541	384	519	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3542	153	788	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3543	493	127	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3544	493	761	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3545	493	396	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3546	493	30	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3547	493	665	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3548	493	299	What grade is she going to teach?
3549	493	934	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3550	493	800	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3551	493	435	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3552	493	69	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3553	704	338	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3554	972	607	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3555	972	241	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3556	972	876	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3557	972	742	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3558	972	377	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3559	972	11	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3560	972	646	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3561	972	280	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3562	972	915	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3563	972	549	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3564	183	818	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3565	684	319	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3566	684	953	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
3567	588	222	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3568	588	857	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3569	588	491	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3570	588	125	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3571	588	760	Where is the dairy products?
3572	626	261	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3573	626	895	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3574	626	530	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3575	626	164	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3576	799	433	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3577	799	68	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3578	799	702	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3579	799	568	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3580	799	203	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3581	799	837	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
3582	472	106	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3583	472	741	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3584	472	375	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3585	472	10	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3586	472	644	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3587	472	510	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3588	472	145	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3589	472	779	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3590	472	414	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3591	48	683	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3592	48	317	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3593	48	952	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3594	48	586	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3596	48	87	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3597	721	356	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3598	721	990	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3599	721	625	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3600	721	259	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3601	721	894	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3602	721	528	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
3603	721	395	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3604	721	29	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3605	721	663	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
3606	298	932	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3607	298	567	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3608	298	201	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3609	298	836	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3610	298	470	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3611	337	971	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3612	337	606	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3613	337	240	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3614	337	874	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3615	509	143	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3616	509	778	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3617	509	412	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3618	509	279	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3619	509	913	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3620	509	548	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3621	182	817	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3622	182	451	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3623	182	85	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3624	182	720	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3625	182	354	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3626	182	59	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3627	182	694	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3628	182	328	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3629	182	962	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3630	597	463	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3631	597	98	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3632	597	732	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3633	597	367	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3634	597	1	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3635	597	636	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3636	270	904	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3637	270	539	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3638	270	405	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3639	270	40	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3640	270	674	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3641	270	309	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3642	270	943	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3643	578	212	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3644	578	847	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3645	578	481	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3646	578	347	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

3649	616	885	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3650	616	520	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3651	616	154	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3652	789	423	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3653	789	290	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3654	789	924	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3655	789	558	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3656	789	193	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3657	789	827	Really? Where are you from?
3658	462	96	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?

3660	462	365	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3661	462	232	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3662	462	866	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.

3664	462	135	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3665	462	769	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3666	462	404	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3667	38	673	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3668	38	307	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3669	38	174	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
3670	38	808	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3671	38	443	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3672	77	711	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3673	77	346	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3674	77	980	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3675	77	615	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3676	249	116	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3677	249	750	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3678	249	385	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3679	249	19	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3680	249	653	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3681	249	288	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3682	249	922	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3683	249	557	She will be happy to meet both of you again.

3687	692	596	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3688	692	230	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3689	692	864	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3690	692	499	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3691	692	133	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3692	692	1000	What grade is she going to teach?
3693	692	634	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3694	269	903	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
3695	269	538	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3696	269	172	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3697	269	806	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3698	269	441	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3699	269	75	What is she doing these days?
3700	942	576	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3701	942	211	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3702	942	845	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3703	942	480	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3704	942	114	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3705	942	749	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3706	942	383	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3707	942	17	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
3708	942	884	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3709	518	153	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3710	518	626	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3711	518	492	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3712	518	126	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
3713	518	761	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3714	518	395	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3715	30	664	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3716	30	299	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3718	30	568	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3719	30	434	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3720	30	69	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3721	30	703	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3722	337	972	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3723	337	606	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3724	337	241	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3725	337	875	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3726	337	510	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3727	376	11	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3728	376	645	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3729	376	279	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3730	914	548	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3731	183	817	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3732	183	452	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3733	183	318	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3734	183	953	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3735	183	587	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3736	183	222	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3737	183	856	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3738	183	490	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3739	183	125	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3740	183	759	What grade is she going to teach?
3741	394	260	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3742	895	529	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3743	895	164	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3744	798	432	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3745	798	67	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3746	798	701	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3747	798	336	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3748	798	202	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3749	837	471	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3750	837	106	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3751	837	740	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3752	837	375	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3753	9	643	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3754	9	278	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3755	9	144	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3756	9	779	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3757	9	413	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
3758	9	48	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3759	682	317	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3760	682	951	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3761	682	586	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3762	682	220	Where is the dairy products?
3763	682	86	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3764	682	721	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3765	682	355	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3766	682	990	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3767	682	624	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3768	259	893	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3769	259	528	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3770	259	162	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3771	259	28	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
3772	259	663	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3773	259	297	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
3774	932	566	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
3775	932	201	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3776	932	835	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3777	932	470	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3834	403	38	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
3778	932	104	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3779	932	971	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
3780	932	605	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3781	932	239	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3782	932	874	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3783	508	143	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3784	508	777	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3785	508	412	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3786	508	46	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3787	508	913	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
3788	508	547	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3789	181	816	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3790	181	450	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3791	181	85	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3792	181	719	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3793	181	424	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3794	181	58	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3795	181	693	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3796	181	327	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3797	181	962	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3798	596	231	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3799	596	97	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3800	596	732	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3801	596	366	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3802	1	635	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3803	1	269	What grade is she going to teach?
3804	1	904	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3805	1	538	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3806	1	173	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3807	1	39	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3808	1	674	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3809	1	308	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3810	943	577	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3811	943	212	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3812	943	846	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3813	943	480	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3814	943	115	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3815	943	981	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3816	943	616	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3817	943	250	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3818	943	885	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3819	943	519	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3820	154	788	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3821	422	57	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3822	422	923	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3823	422	558	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3824	422	192	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3825	422	827	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3826	422	461	Im going to watch Terminator 4.

3831	865	500	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3832	865	134	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3833	865	769	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3835	403	672	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3836	403	307	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3837	403	941	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
3838	403	807	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
3839	403	442	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3840	403	76	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
3841	403	711	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3842	403	345	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3843	403	980	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3844	614	249	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3845	883	750	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
3846	883	384	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3847	18	653	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3848	18	287	Really? Where are you from?
3849	18	922	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3850	18	556	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?

3859	692	133	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3860	692	767	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3861	692	634	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
3862	268	903	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3863	268	537	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3864	268	171	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3865	268	806	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3866	268	440	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3867	75	709	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3868	75	576	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3869	210	845	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3870	210	479	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3871	210	114	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3872	210	748	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3873	210	382	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3874	210	17	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3875	210	651	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3876	356	991	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
3877	356	625	How often do you eat at this cafe?
3878	356	259	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3879	126	760	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3880	126	395	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3881	126	29	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3882	664	298	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3883	933	567	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
3884	933	201	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3885	933	68	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3886	933	702	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3887	933	337	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3888	933	971	Morning. How’s are you today?
3889	933	606	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3890	933	240	Where is the dairy products?
3891	933	875	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
3892	933	509	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
3893	144	10	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3894	644	279	What movie are you and the family going to see?
3895	644	913	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
3896	548	182	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
3897	548	817	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3898	548	451	Am sorry. what was your name again?
3899	548	86	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3900	548	952	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
3901	587	221	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
3902	587	855	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
3903	587	490	Freezing cold, and snowing.
3904	587	124	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
3905	759	393	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
3906	759	28	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3907	759	894	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
3908	759	529	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
3909	759	163	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
3910	759	797	Really? Where are you from?
3911	432	66	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
3912	432	701	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3913	432	335	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3914	432	970	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3915	432	836	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3916	432	471	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
3917	432	105	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3918	432	740	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3919	432	374	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3920	8	643	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3921	8	277	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3922	8	912	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3923	8	778	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3924	8	413	Not so bad, thanks, you?
3925	8	47	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3926	682	316	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3927	682	950	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3928	682	585	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3929	682	219	What grade is she going to teach?
3930	682	854	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3931	682	720	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3932	682	355	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3933	682	989	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3934	682	624	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3935	258	893	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
3936	258	527	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3937	258	161	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
3938	258	796	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
3939	258	662	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
3940	297	931	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3941	297	566	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3942	297	200	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3943	297	835	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3944	469	103	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
3945	469	738	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
3946	469	604	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
3947	469	239	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3948	469	873	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
3949	469	508	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3950	142	777	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
3951	142	411	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
3952	142	46	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
3953	142	680	Where is the dairy products?
3954	142	546	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
3955	142	181	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4369	432	374	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
3956	142	815	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3957	142	450	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
3958	142	923	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
3959	789	423	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
3960	789	896	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
3961	789	531	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3962	789	397	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
3963	789	32	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
3964	789	666	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
3965	300	935	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
3966	300	569	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
3967	300	204	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
3968	300	838	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
3969	300	473	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
3970	300	339	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
3971	300	974	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
3972	300	608	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
3973	243	877	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
3974	243	511	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
3975	243	146	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
3976	243	780	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
3977	243	415	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
3978	243	281	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
3979	243	916	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
3980	243	550	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
3981	243	185	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
3982	243	819	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
3983	453	88	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
3984	722	357	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
3985	722	223	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
3986	722	858	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
3987	722	492	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
3988	722	127	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
3989	722	761	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
3990	722	396	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
3991	722	30	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
3992	722	664	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
3993	722	299	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
3994	165	800	What grade is she going to teach?
3995	165	434	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
3996	165	69	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
3997	703	338	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
3998	703	972	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
3999	703	607	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4000	703	241	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4001	703	107	What is she doing these days?
4002	703	742	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4003	703	376	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4004	703	11	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4005	703	645	How often do you eat at this cafe?
4006	703	280	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4007	914	549	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4008	183	49	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4009	183	684	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4010	183	318	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4011	183	953	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4012	183	587	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
4013	183	222	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4014	183	856	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4015	183	491	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4016	183	125	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4017	183	992	Morning. How’s are you today?
4018	626	260	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4019	626	895	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4020	626	529	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4021	164	798	What is she doing these days?
4022	433	67	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4023	433	934	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
4024	433	568	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4025	433	202	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
4026	433	837	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4027	433	471	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4028	433	106	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4029	433	740	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4030	433	375	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4031	433	9	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4032	876	510	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4033	876	145	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4034	876	779	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4035	413	48	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
4036	682	317	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4037	682	951	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4038	682	818	Really? Where are you from?
4039	682	452	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4040	682	87	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4041	682	559	What grade is she going to teach?
4042	682	194	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4043	682	60	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
4044	682	695	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4045	682	329	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4046	964	598	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4047	233	867	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4048	233	501	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4049	233	136	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4050	233	2	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4051	233	637	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4052	233	271	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4053	233	906	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4054	233	540	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.

4060	848	482	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4061	848	117	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4062	848	751	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4063	848	386	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.

4072	59	828	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4073	59	463	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4074	59	97	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4075	732	366	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4076	732	1	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4077	732	635	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4078	732	270	Freezing cold, and snowing.

4081	732	405	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4082	732	39	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4083	732	674	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4084	308	943	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4085	308	577	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4086	308	212	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4087	308	846	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.

4092	982	885	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4093	982	519	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4094	982	154	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4095	982	788	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4096	982	655	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4097	982	289	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4098	982	924	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4099	558	192	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4100	558	827	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4101	558	461	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4102	558	96	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.

4107	597	135	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4108	769	403	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4109	769	38	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4110	769	672	How often do you eat at this cafe?
4111	769	539	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.

4117	442	980	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4118	442	614	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
4119	442	481	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4120	442	115	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4121	442	750	What grade is she going to teach?
4122	442	384	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
4123	19	653	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
4124	19	358	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4125	19	992	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
4126	19	627	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4127	19	261	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4128	19	896	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4129	530	165	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4130	530	31	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4370	8	642	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4131	530	665	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4132	530	300	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4133	530	934	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4134	530	569	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4135	530	203	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4136	838	472	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4137	838	107	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4138	838	973	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4139	838	608	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4140	838	242	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4141	876	511	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4142	876	145	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4143	876	780	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4144	876	414	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4145	49	915	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4146	49	550	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4147	49	184	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4148	49	818	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4149	49	453	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4150	49	87	Really? Where are you from?
4151	722	356	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4152	722	991	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4153	722	857	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4154	722	492	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4155	722	126	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4156	722	761	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4157	722	395	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4158	722	29	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4159	722	664	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4160	298	933	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
4161	298	799	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4162	298	434	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4163	298	68	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
4164	298	703	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4165	298	337	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4166	971	606	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4167	971	240	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4168	971	875	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4169	971	741	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4170	971	376	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4171	971	10	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
4172	971	645	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4173	971	279	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4174	971	914	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4175	548	182	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4176	548	817	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4177	548	683	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4178	548	318	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4179	548	952	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
4180	587	221	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4181	587	856	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4182	587	490	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4183	587	124	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4184	759	625	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4185	759	260	What grade is she going to teach?
4186	759	894	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4187	759	529	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4188	759	163	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
4189	759	798	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4190	432	67	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4191	432	701	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4192	432	567	What is she doing these days?
4371	8	277	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4193	432	202	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4194	432	836	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4195	432	471	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4196	432	105	How often do you eat at this cafe?
4197	432	740	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4198	432	374	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4199	9	643	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4200	9	510	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4201	9	144	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4202	9	778	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4203	9	413	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4204	9	47	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4205	682	316	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4206	682	951	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4207	682	585	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4208	682	290	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4209	682	924	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4210	682	559	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4211	682	193	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
4212	682	828	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4213	682	694	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4214	329	963	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4215	329	597	Really? Where are you from?
4216	329	232	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4217	329	866	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4218	329	501	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4219	329	135	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4220	770	636	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4221	770	271	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4222	770	905	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4223	770	540	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4224	770	174	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4225	770	808	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4226	770	443	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
4227	770	77	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4228	770	712	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4229	578	213	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4230	578	847	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4231	578	482	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4232	578	116	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4233	578	750	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4234	385	19	What grade is she going to teach?
4235	385	654	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4236	520	155	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4237	520	789	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4238	520	424	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4239	520	58	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4240	520	693	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4241	520	327	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4242	520	961	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4243	520	596	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4244	462	97	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4245	462	731	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4246	462	366	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4247	462	1000	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4248	462	635	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4249	462	269	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4250	462	904	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4251	462	538	What grade is she going to teach?
4252	462	404	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4253	462	39	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4254	673	308	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4255	942	577	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4256	942	211	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4257	942	846	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4258	942	480	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4259	942	346	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4260	942	981	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4261	942	615	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4262	942	250	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4263	942	884	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4264	519	153	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4265	519	788	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4266	519	422	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4267	519	289	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4268	519	923	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4269	519	557	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4270	192	826	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4271	192	461	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4272	192	95	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4273	192	730	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4274	192	364	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4275	192	231	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4276	192	865	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4277	192	499	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4278	192	134	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4279	768	403	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4280	768	37	Really? Where are you from?

4283	768	173	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
4284	768	807	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4285	442	76	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.

4289	442	614	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4290	442	248	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4291	442	115	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4292	442	749	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4293	442	384	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
4294	856	723	Not so bad, thanks, you?

4296	856	992	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4297	856	626	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4298	261	895	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4299	261	530	What grade is she going to teach?
4300	261	164	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
4301	261	798	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4302	261	665	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4303	261	299	Where is the dairy products?
4304	261	934	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4305	261	568	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4306	203	837	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4307	203	472	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4308	203	106	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
4309	203	740	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4310	203	607	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4311	203	241	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4312	203	876	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4313	203	510	Am sorry. what was your name again?
4314	203	145	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4315	203	779	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4316	414	48	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
4317	683	549	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4318	683	183	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4319	683	818	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4320	683	452	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
4321	683	87	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4322	683	721	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4323	683	356	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4324	683	990	Where is the dairy products?
4325	683	625	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4326	683	491	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4327	125	760	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4328	125	394	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4329	125	29	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4330	663	298	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4331	932	567	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4332	932	433	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4333	932	68	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4334	932	702	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4335	932	336	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4336	932	971	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4337	932	605	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4338	932	240	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4339	932	874	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4340	509	375	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4341	509	10	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4342	509	644	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4343	509	279	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4344	509	913	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4345	509	547	Really? Where are you from?
4346	182	816	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4347	182	451	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4348	182	317	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4349	182	952	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4350	182	586	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4351	182	221	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4352	182	855	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4353	182	489	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4354	182	124	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4355	758	393	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
4356	758	259	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4357	758	894	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4358	758	528	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
4359	758	163	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4360	758	797	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4361	432	66	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4362	432	700	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4363	432	335	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4364	432	201	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4365	432	836	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4366	432	470	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
4367	432	105	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4368	432	739	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4372	8	143	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4373	8	778	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4374	8	412	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4375	47	681	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4376	47	316	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4377	47	20	Am sorry. what was your name again?
4378	47	655	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4379	289	924	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4380	289	558	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
4381	289	193	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4382	289	827	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
4383	289	462	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4384	289	328	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4385	289	962	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
4386	597	231	Morning. How’s are you today?
4387	597	866	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4388	597	500	Where is the dairy products?
4389	597	135	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4390	769	404	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4391	769	270	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4392	769	905	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4393	769	539	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4394	769	173	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
4395	769	808	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4396	442	77	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4397	442	711	Am sorry. what was your name again?
4398	442	346	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4399	442	212	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4400	442	847	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4401	442	481	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4402	442	115	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4403	442	750	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4404	442	384	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4405	442	19	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4406	653	288	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4407	653	154	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4408	653	789	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4409	653	423	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4410	653	58	Really? Where are you from?
4411	653	692	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4412	653	326	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4413	653	961	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4414	653	595	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4415	653	230	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4416	96	731	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4417	96	365	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4418	96	1000	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4419	634	268	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4420	903	537	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4421	903	172	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4422	903	38	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4423	903	673	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4424	903	307	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4425	903	942	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4426	903	576	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4427	903	211	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4428	903	845	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4429	903	479	What grade is she going to teach?
4430	114	980	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4431	114	615	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4432	114	249	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4780	610	514	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4433	884	518	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4434	153	787	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4435	153	422	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4436	153	56	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4437	153	922	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4438	153	557	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4439	153	191	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4440	153	826	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4441	153	460	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4442	153	95	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4443	153	729	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4444	364	998	What grade is she going to teach?
4445	864	499	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4446	864	133	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4447	768	402	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4448	768	37	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4449	768	671	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4450	768	306	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4451	768	940	Where is the dairy products?
4452	807	441	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4453	807	75	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4454	807	710	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4455	807	344	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4456	979	613	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
4457	979	318	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4458	979	952	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
4459	979	587	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4460	979	221	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4461	979	856	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4462	490	357	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4463	490	991	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4464	490	626	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4465	490	260	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4466	490	894	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4467	490	529	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4468	490	163	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4469	798	432	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4470	798	299	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4471	798	933	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4472	798	568	Really? Where are you from?
4473	798	202	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.

4475	837	105	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4476	837	740	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
4477	837	374	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4478	241	875	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4479	241	510	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4480	241	144	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4481	241	779	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4482	241	413	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
4483	241	48	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4484	241	682	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
4485	241	316	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4486	183	817	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
4487	183	452	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4488	183	86	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4489	183	721	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4490	183	355	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4491	183	990	What grade is she going to teach?
4492	183	624	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
4493	183	258	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4494	183	125	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4495	183	759	Where is the dairy products?
4496	394	28	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4497	663	297	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4498	663	932	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4499	663	636	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4500	663	271	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4501	663	905	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4502	663	540	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4503	663	174	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4504	663	809	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4505	663	443	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4506	663	310	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4507	944	578	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4508	213	847	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4509	213	482	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4510	213	116	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4511	213	751	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4512	213	385	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4513	213	252	Morning. How’s are you today?
4514	213	886	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4515	213	520	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4516	213	155	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4517	213	789	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4518	424	58	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4519	693	327	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4520	693	194	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.

4530	136	405	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4531	136	39	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4532	674	308	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
4533	942	577	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.

4540	942	250	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4541	942	955	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.

4547	493	262	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4548	493	897	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4549	493	531	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4550	493	166	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4551	493	800	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4552	493	435	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4553	493	69	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4554	704	570	What grade is she going to teach?

4556	204	473	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.

4569	319	89	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4570	319	723	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4571	319	357	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4572	992	626	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4573	992	261	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4574	992	895	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4575	992	530	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4576	992	396	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4577	992	31	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4578	992	665	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4579	992	300	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4580	992	934	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4581	568	203	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4582	568	837	Really? Where are you from?
4583	568	472	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4584	568	338	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4585	568	973	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
4586	568	607	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4587	242	876	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4588	242	510	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4589	242	145	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4590	242	779	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4591	242	414	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4592	242	280	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4593	242	915	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4594	242	549	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4595	242	184	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4596	818	453	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4597	818	87	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4598	818	721	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4599	818	356	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4600	818	222	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
4601	857	491	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4604	857	395	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4605	29	663	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4606	29	298	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4607	29	164	How often do you eat at this cafe?
4608	29	799	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4609	29	433	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4610	29	68	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4611	702	337	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4612	702	971	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4613	702	606	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4614	702	240	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4615	702	106	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
4616	702	741	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4617	702	375	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
4618	702	10	What grade is she going to teach?
4619	702	644	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
4620	279	913	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
4621	279	548	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4622	279	182	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4623	279	49	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
4624	279	521	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4625	279	156	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4626	790	425	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4627	790	291	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4628	790	926	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4629	790	560	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4630	790	194	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4631	790	829	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4632	790	463	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
4633	98	732	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4634	98	367	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4635	98	233	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4636	98	868	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4637	98	502	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4638	136	771	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4639	136	405	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4640	136	40	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4641	136	674	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4642	309	175	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4643	309	810	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4644	309	444	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4645	309	79	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4646	309	713	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4647	309	347	Really? Where are you from?
4648	309	982	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4649	309	616	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4650	251	117	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4651	251	752	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4652	251	386	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4653	251	21	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4654	251	655	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4655	251	289	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.

4659	251	59	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4660	694	328	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!

4662	963	232	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4663	963	866	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.

4665	963	135	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4666	963	1	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4667	963	636	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4668	963	270	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
4669	963	905	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4670	963	539	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4671	174	808	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4672	443	77	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4673	443	943	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4674	443	578	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4675	443	212	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4676	443	847	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4677	443	481	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
4678	443	116	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4679	443	750	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4680	443	385	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4681	443	19	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4682	885	520	What grade is she going to teach?
4683	885	154	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4684	885	789	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4685	423	58	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4686	423	692	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4687	423	327	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4688	423	961	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4689	423	828	What is she doing these days?
4690	423	462	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4691	423	96	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4692	423	731	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4693	423	365	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4694	423	1000	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4695	634	269	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4696	903	770	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4697	903	404	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4698	903	38	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4699	903	673	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4700	903	307	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

4723	703	838	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4724	703	473	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4725	703	107	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.

4733	146	49	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4734	684	318	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4735	953	587	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4736	953	222	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper.

4770	452	760	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4771	452	394	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.

4790	725	429	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4791	725	64	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4792	698	333	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4793	698	967	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4794	698	834	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
4795	698	468	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4796	698	102	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
4797	737	371	Morning. How’s are you today?
4798	737	6	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4799	737	640	Where is the dairy products?
4800	737	275	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4801	909	776	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4802	909	410	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4803	909	45	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4804	909	679	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4805	909	313	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
4806	909	948	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4807	909	582	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
4808	909	217	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4809	851	718	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4810	851	352	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
4811	851	987	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4812	851	621	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4813	851	255	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4814	851	890	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4815	851	524	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4816	851	159	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4817	851	793	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4818	851	660	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4819	294	929	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4820	563	198	Really? Where are you from?
4821	563	832	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4822	563	466	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4823	563	101	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4824	563	735	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4825	563	602	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
4826	563	236	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4827	563	871	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4828	563	505	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4829	563	140	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4830	774	408	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4831	43	677	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4832	43	544	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4833	43	178	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4834	43	813	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4835	43	447	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
4836	43	82	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4837	43	716	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
4838	43	351	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4839	43	985	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4840	43	619	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
4841	486	120	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4842	486	755	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4843	486	389	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
4844	24	658	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
4845	293	927	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4846	293	561	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
4847	293	428	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
4848	293	62	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4849	293	697	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
4850	293	331	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4851	293	966	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4852	293	600	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4853	293	235	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4854	293	869	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4855	504	370	What grade is she going to teach?
4856	504	4	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4857	504	639	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4858	273	908	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
4859	542	177	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
4860	542	811	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4861	542	446	What is she doing these days?
4862	542	312	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4863	542	947	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
4864	542	581	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
4865	542	215	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4866	542	850	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4867	542	484	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4868	119	753	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4869	119	388	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4870	119	254	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4871	119	889	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4872	119	523	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4873	119	996	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
4874	862	497	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
4875	862	131	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
4876	862	766	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
4877	862	400	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4878	862	34	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4879	862	669	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
4880	862	303	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
4881	862	938	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
4882	862	804	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4883	439	73	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4884	439	708	Really? Where are you from?
4885	439	342	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
4886	439	977	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4887	439	611	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
4888	439	245	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
4889	880	746	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4890	880	381	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
4891	880	15	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
4892	880	650	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
4893	880	284	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
4894	880	919	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
4895	880	553	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
4896	187	822	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
4897	187	688	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
4898	187	323	Not so bad, thanks, you?
4899	187	957	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
4900	187	592	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5023	503	137	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
4901	226	861	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4902	226	495	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4903	226	130	What grade is she going to teach?
4904	764	630	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
4905	265	899	Where is the dairy products?
4906	265	534	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4907	168	803	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4908	168	437	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
4909	168	72	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
4910	168	706	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
4911	168	573	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
4912	207	841	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4913	207	476	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4914	207	110	Am sorry. what was your name again?
4915	207	745	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4916	379	14	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4917	379	648	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
4918	379	515	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
4919	379	149	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
4920	379	783	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.

4931	52	629	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4932	263	898	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
4933	532	399	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
4934	532	33	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4935	532	668	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
4936	532	302	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.

4940	532	840	Freezing cold, and snowing.
4941	532	474	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
4942	341	975	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4943	341	610	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
4944	341	244	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
4945	341	879	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
4946	341	513	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
4947	341	147	Really? Where are you from?

4949	341	416	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
4950	283	917	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
4951	283	552	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?

4963	332	102	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
4964	332	736	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
4965	332	371	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
4966	332	5	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
4967	332	640	What grade is she going to teach?
4968	332	274	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
4969	909	543	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
4970	909	409	Where is the dairy products?
4971	909	44	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
4972	909	678	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
4973	909	313	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
4974	909	947	What is she doing these days?
4975	582	216	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.

4978	582	352	Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
4979	582	986	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
4980	582	620	Am sorry. what was your name again?
4981	582	255	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
4982	582	889	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
4983	582	524	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
4984	158	793	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
4985	158	427	What’s the weather like in Russia now?

4989	197	831	Morning. How’s are you today?
4990	197	466	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
4991	197	100	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
4992	197	735	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
4993	369	236	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
4994	369	870	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
4995	369	505	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
4996	369	139	What movie are you and the family going to see?
4997	369	773	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.

4999	369	42	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5000	369	677	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5001	311	178	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.

5005	311	716	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5006	311	350	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5007	311	984	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5008	311	619	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
5009	311	253	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
5010	311	120	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5011	754	389	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5012	23	658	Really? Where are you from?
5013	23	292	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
5014	23	926	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
5015	23	561	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
5016	23	195	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
5017	23	62	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5018	23	696	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5019	23	331	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5020	23	965	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
5021	23	600	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5022	234	869	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5024	503	4	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5025	503	638	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
5026	503	273	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5027	503	907	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
5028	503	542	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5029	503	176	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
5030	503	811	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5031	503	445	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
5032	503	79	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
5033	946	580	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
5034	946	215	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5035	946	849	Where is the dairy products?
5036	484	118	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
5037	753	387	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
5038	753	22	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
5039	753	888	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5040	753	522	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
5041	753	995	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5042	753	630	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5043	753	496	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
5044	753	131	Am sorry. what was your name again?
5045	753	765	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5046	753	399	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
5047	34	668	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
5048	303	937	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
5049	303	572	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
5050	303	438	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
5051	303	73	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
5052	303	707	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
5053	303	342	Morning. How’s are you today?
5054	303	976	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
5055	303	610	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
5056	303	245	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
5057	303	879	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5058	514	380	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5059	15	649	What movie are you and the family going to see?
5060	15	284	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
5061	918	552	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5062	918	187	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5063	918	821	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5064	918	456	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5065	918	322	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
5066	957	591	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5067	957	226	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5068	957	860	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5069	957	495	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5070	129	763	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5071	129	398	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
5072	129	264	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
5073	129	899	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5074	129	533	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
5075	129	168	Really? Where are you from?
5076	802	437	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
5077	802	71	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
5078	802	705	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
5079	802	340	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
5080	802	206	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
5081	802	841	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5082	802	475	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
5083	802	110	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5084	802	744	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
5085	379	13	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
5086	379	648	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5087	379	282	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5088	379	148	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
5089	379	783	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5090	379	417	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5091	52	686	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
5092	52	321	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5093	52	955	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
5094	52	590	What grade is she going to teach?
5095	52	224	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
5096	52	91	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
5097	52	725	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5098	52	359	Where is the dairy products?
5099	52	994	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
5100	628	263	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
5101	628	897	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
5102	628	532	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
5103	628	166	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
5104	628	33	I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
5105	628	667	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
5106	301	936	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
5107	301	570	Am sorry. what was your name again?
5108	301	205	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5109	301	839	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
5110	301	474	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
5111	301	108	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5112	301	743	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
5113	301	609	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
5114	301	244	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
5115	878	512	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
5116	878	147	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
5117	878	781	Morning. How’s are you today?
5118	878	416	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
5119	878	50	Where is the dairy products?
5120	685	551	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
5121	685	186	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
5122	685	820	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5123	685	454	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
5124	89	723	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
5125	89	428	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
5126	89	63	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5127	89	697	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5128	89	331	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5129	89	966	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5130	600	235	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
5131	600	101	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5132	600	736	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5133	600	370	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5134	600	5	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5135	600	639	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.

5138	542	177	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5139	542	43	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.

5191	330	137	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5192	330	771	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?

5195	638	541	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5196	638	176	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5197	638	810	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5198	444	79	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
5199	444	713	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5200	580	214	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
5319	753	792	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5201	580	849	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5202	580	483	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.

5206	580	21	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
5207	655	522	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5208	655	995	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5209	655	629	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
5210	264	130	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5211	764	399	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5212	764	33	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
5213	668	302	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5214	668	937	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
5215	668	571	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
5216	668	206	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
5217	668	72	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5218	706	341	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5219	706	975	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
5220	706	610	What grade is she going to teach?
5221	706	244	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
5222	879	513	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
5223	879	148	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
5224	879	14	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
5225	879	649	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
5226	879	283	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
5227	879	917	What is she doing these days?
5228	552	186	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
5229	552	821	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
5230	552	455	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5231	552	90	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5232	552	724	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
5233	552	591	Am sorry. what was your name again?
5234	552	225	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5235	552	859	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
5236	552	494	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
5237	128	763	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
5238	128	397	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
5239	128	32	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
5240	128	666	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
5241	128	533	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
5242	128	167	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
5243	802	436	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
5244	802	70	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
5245	802	705	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
5246	802	339	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5247	802	974	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
5248	802	608	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5249	802	475	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
5250	802	109	What movie are you and the family going to see?
5251	802	744	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
5252	378	13	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5253	378	647	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5254	378	281	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5255	378	916	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5256	378	550	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
5257	417	51	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5258	417	686	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5259	417	320	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5260	417	955	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5261	589	223	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5262	589	858	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
5263	589	492	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
5264	589	359	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5265	589	993	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
5266	589	628	Really? Where are you from?
5267	262	897	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
5268	262	531	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
5269	262	166	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
5270	262	800	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
5271	262	434	She will be happy to meet both of you again.
5272	262	301	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5273	262	935	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
5274	262	570	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5275	262	204	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
5276	839	473	That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
5277	839	108	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5278	839	742	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5279	839	376	Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
5280	839	243	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5281	839	877	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5282	512	146	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
5283	512	781	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5284	512	415	Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
5285	512	50	What grade is she going to teach?
5286	512	684	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
5287	512	319	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
5288	512	185	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5289	512	819	Where is the dairy products?
5290	512	454	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
5291	927	793	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
5292	927	428	What is she doing these days?
5293	927	62	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
5294	927	696	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
5295	331	965	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
5296	331	600	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5297	331	234	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
5298	331	869	What movie are you and the family going to see?
5299	331	735	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5300	331	370	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
5301	331	4	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
5302	331	639	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
5303	273	907	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
5304	273	542	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
5305	273	176	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
5306	273	811	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5307	273	677	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
5308	273	312	Morning. How’s are you today?
5309	273	946	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
5310	273	581	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
5311	273	215	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
5312	273	849	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5313	484	118	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5314	753	619	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
5315	753	254	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
5316	753	888	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
5317	753	523	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5318	753	157	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5320	753	426	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5321	753	60	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5322	753	695	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
5323	753	561	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5324	196	830	Freezing cold, and snowing.
5325	196	465	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5326	196	99	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
5327	734	368	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
5328	2	637	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
5329	2	503	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
5330	2	138	Really? Where are you from?
5331	2	772	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
5332	2	407	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
5333	2	41	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.

5339	445	714	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5340	445	349	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5341	983	618	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5342	983	252	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5343	983	887	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
5344	983	521	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
5345	983	388	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5346	983	22	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5347	983	656	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?

5367	713	214	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
5368	713	848	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
5369	713	483	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?

5440	342	478	Really? Where are you from?
5441	342	112	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
5442	342	747	I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
5443	342	381	My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
5444	342	16	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?

5446	342	285	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5447	342	151	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5448	785	420	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5449	785	54	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5450	785	689	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5451	323	958	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5452	323	592	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5453	323	227	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
5454	323	93	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5455	323	727	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5456	323	362	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
5457	323	835	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5458	323	469	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5459	323	336	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
5460	323	970	What grade is she going to teach?
5461	604	239	What’s the weather like in Russia now?
5462	604	873	Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
5463	508	142	I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
5464	508	777	Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
5465	508	411	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
5466	508	278	What is she doing these days?
5467	508	912	Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
5468	547	181	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
5469	547	815	This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
5470	547	450	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5471	547	84	Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
5472	719	353	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5473	719	220	Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
5474	719	854	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
5475	719	489	Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
5476	719	123	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
5477	719	758	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
5478	392	26	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
5479	392	661	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5480	392	295	That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
5481	392	162	Morning. How’s are you today?
5482	392	796	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
5483	392	431	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
5484	392	65	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
5485	392	700	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5486	392	334	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
5487	968	603	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
5488	968	237	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
5489	968	104	I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
5490	968	738	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
5491	968	373	So, what are your plans for this weekend?
5492	968	7	Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
5493	642	276	I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
5494	642	911	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5495	642	545	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
5496	642	179	Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
5497	642	46	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5498	642	680	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
5499	642	315	Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
5500	642	949	Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
5501	642	584	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5502	218	853	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5503	218	487	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
5504	218	121	I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
5505	218	988	Really? Where are you from?
5506	218	622	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
5507	257	891	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
5508	257	526	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
5509	257	160	I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
5510	257	795	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5511	429	64	The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
5512	429	930	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5513	429	564	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5514	429	199	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5515	429	833	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
5516	429	468	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
5517	102	737	OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
5518	102	371	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
5519	102	6	Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
5520	102	872	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5521	102	506	It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
5522	102	141	Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
5523	102	775	Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
5524	102	410	What grade is she going to teach?
5525	102	44	Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
5526	679	313	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
5527	679	948	Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
5528	679	814	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
5529	679	449	Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
5530	679	83	I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
5531	679	717	What is she doing these days?
5532	352	986	They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
5533	352	621	Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
5534	352	255	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5535	352	890	00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
5536	352	756	That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
5537	352	391	Am sorry. what was your name again?
5538	352	25	Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
5539	352	660	The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
5540	352	364	Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
5541	999	633	OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
5542	999	268	Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
5543	999	902	Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
5544	999	537	Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
5545	999	171	She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
5546	999	805	Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
5547	440	306	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
5548	440	941	You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
5549	440	575	How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
5550	440	210	Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
5551	440	844	Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
5552	440	479	She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
5553	440	113	I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
5554	747	382	There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
5555	747	248	Well you get the dairy ingredients.
5557	747	517	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
5558	747	152	So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
5559	786	421	Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
5560	786	55	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
5561	786	690	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5562	324	190	Right! So this must be like summer for you!
5563	825	459	Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
5564	825	94	She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
5565	728	363	Not so bad, thanks, you?
5566	728	997	Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
5567	728	632	Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
5568	728	266	That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
5569	728	133	So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
5570	767	401	Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
5571	767	36	Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
5572	767	670	Im going to watch Terminator 4.
5573	767	305	You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
5574	939	574	I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
5575	939	208	Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
5576	939	75	How often do you eat at this cafe?
5577	939	709	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
5578	939	343	Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
5579	939	978	Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?

5609	611	112	Morning. How’s are you today?
5610	611	746	There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.

5623	323	565	Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
5624	323	200	I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
5625	323	834	Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
5626	323	469	Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
