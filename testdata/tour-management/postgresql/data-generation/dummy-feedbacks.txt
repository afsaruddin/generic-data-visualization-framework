Oh, hi Sarah Im have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
How often do you eat at this cafe?
This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
Hello, my name is David Its nice to meet you.
Hi, Im Jenny. Its my please to meet you.
Am sorry. what was your name again?
So Jenny, What do you do for a living?
I work at the local school teaching English. what do you for a living?
Im also an English teacher, but am currently out of work.
Sorry to hear that. It has been really nice talking to you.
Yes. It was a great pleasure meeting you.
Hi Jason, its great to see you again.
Wow, its great seeing you,  How long has it been? It most be more than 6 months. Im doing good. How about you?
What movie are you and the family going to see?
I came here to see the Simpsons movie. How about you?
Im going to watch Terminator 4.
Morning. How’s are you today?
Not so bad, thanks, you?
Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!
Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!
The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.
They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.
Really? Where are you from?
What’s the weather like in Russia now?
Freezing cold, and snowing.
Right! So this must be like summer for you!
Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
So, what are your plans for this weekend?
I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago.
I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.
She will be happy to meet both of you again.
What is she doing these days?
She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
What grade is she going to teach?
She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. 
Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?
I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
Hey Alexis, I am glad you decided to come over to my house to study for our upcoming exam.  The sociology test seems to be very difficult.  I have studied all the materials, but I am still not confident about my performance this Friday.
Yes, this test is going to be hard, but since you have covered all the materials, you
That sounds like a good idea.  Let’s start!
Well, in chapter one, the book covers the three fundamental points of view on sociology. Do you know what these three points of view are?
Yes, I think I do.  They are the Functionalist, the Conflict, and the Interactionist perspectives.  Is that right?
Yes!  You got it!  Good job!
Thanks, Alexis!  But what does each perspective believe?
Well, you know what the Functionalist Perspective talks about.  It is the easiest to remember.
Oh yes!  That one talks about how everyone has a function in society.  It states that everyone has a function in life where their collective actions will be put together for the benefit of society.
That is correct!  No need to ask, but I think you understand very well what the other two perspectives are all about, right?
Yes, I can explain very precisely what they are. There is no need for me to do a review on them.  Let’s finish the other chapters.
Well, how about you quiz me on chapter two.
Sure.  Well, in chapter two, the book discusses Max Weber.  Who was Max Weber and what was his opinion on the issue of organization?
Well, Max Weber was one of the founders of the modern study of sociology. He believed that organizing requires communication, coordination, and control.
That is correct!  You are doing really well too, Alexis!
Thanks Mary!  I feel pretty good about chapter two.  Let’s take a break right now and we will finish going over the main parts of chapter three when we come back.
Chapter three is the most difficult chapter. I have read the chapter twice on top of reviewing all my lecture notes, and it is still quite confusing. Maybe I just made a big deal out of nothing.
Chapter three covers quite a few different concepts. It might be better for us to write down each concept and then carefully do a comparison of their similarities and differences. I bet our teacher will ask us to write a short essay on each concept as part of the exam.
Do you think so? I better get myself prepared since we only have an hour to finish the exam. I am never good at writing as I always have difficulties putting my thoughts on paper. I have worked so hard to overcome this problem, but I still have not improved much. Maybe, I have a tendency of over analyzing things.
I do not think that is your problem. It is probably a case of anxiety. Try to relax and take it easy. Things get worse when you do not have control of yourself.
I know, I know. However, I cannot help it. It is good that you suggested we take a break. I need to have a clear mind when we start on chapter three. Let’s go find something to eat and listen to some soothing music for a while.
Hey, Deborah. take a look at those desserts they look so good! How about baking a cake when we get home?
Hmm ... Yes, that’s a brilliant idea! We better buy some ingredients then, while we are here.
OK, do you know what we need to bake a cake?
The recipe I use calls for flour, sugar, icing sugar and butter. Oh! I nearly forgot, and we also need some eggs and chocolate chips and a chocolate flake to sprinkle on top.
Well you get the dairy ingredients.
Where is the dairy products?
You’ll find them in the refrigerated section in aisle 16 and 17, which is next to the frozen section. I’ll get all the other ingredients, as they’re in aisle 6.
Great! then, Let’s meet at the checkout. Im so looking forward to baking this cake now
OK. Lets do it. See you there shortly.
