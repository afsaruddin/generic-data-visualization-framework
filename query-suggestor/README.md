# GDVF - Query Suggestor
This module is responsible for suggesting possible correct queries to the raw query that a user is typing.
For publishing the suggestions, it will have 2 way WebSocket communications.

# Dependencies

##### Python 2.7.9

##### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

A `C` compiler, either `GCC` or `clang`, is needed because the `numpy` library we are using has some C extensions, which will need to be compiled.
We suggest to install the whole `build-essential` and `python-dev`

`apt-get install build-essential python-dev`

##### [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
A Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. We used it for establishing the websocket communication between the users and for exposing a http API for `Query Handler` module by which it will feed query history to all currently connected user.

`pip install tornado`

# API Endpoints

##### websocket endpoint

Recieves a query and sends suggestions for that.

- Url: ws://169.44.61.115:9090/ws ( Example endpoint; Deployed in [Koding VM](https://koding.com) )

##### http endpoint

Recievs query(json data) as `request body` that is pushed to all connected clients.

- Url: http://169.44.61.115:9090/pushhistory
- Method: POST
